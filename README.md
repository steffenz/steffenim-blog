# Personal website (steffen.im).
Hi there! :wave:

This project is intended to serve as a blog over at steffen.im. 

My goal (besides world domination) is to write about technology, life, universe, and everything in-between (let's be honest, probably a lot of code).

Hopefully somebody can learn something from it. And I can use it as a reference - everybody wins.

My intention is to keep this repository public to make it easy for people to fork and/or gain inspiration from to create their own blogs.

My plan is to build everything with NextJS from Markdown and host it at Netlify. Probably won't be using a CMS at this time. Maybe I'll throw in a S3 bucket if there's a lot of cat gifs. Time will show!

Again, this is a work in progress. Thanks for stepping by! :smiley_cat:
